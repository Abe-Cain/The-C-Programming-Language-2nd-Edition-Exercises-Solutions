# The C Programming Language (2nd Edition) - Exercises

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository contains my solutions to all exercises from *The C Programming Language (2nd Edition)* by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie. The exercises are organized chapter by chapter and section by section.

## 📖 About the Book
*The C Programming Language* (often referred to as K&R) is one of the most influential programming books, written by the creators of C. It serves as both a tutorial and a reference for learning C programming.

## 📌 Repository Structure
The exercises are structured as follows:

```
📂 Chapter_1
 ├── 📄 exercise_1-1.c
 ├── 📄 exercise_1-2.c
 ├── ...
📂 Chapter_2
 ├── 📄 exercise_2-1.c
 ├── 📄 exercise_2-2.c
 ├── ...
...
```

Each chapter has its own folder, and each exercise is a separate `.c` file.
Happy coding! 🚀
